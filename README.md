## Overview
I created a multi-page website 

## Websites and Resources
When designing my webpage I used the below listed sites for the resources I needed;
- For all the images I used [](https://www.pexels.com) 

- To reduce the size of my images I used photo edit to resize it by focusing on the aspect ratio and I used [](https://tinypng.com) to compress my images in other to increase the load time

- I used  [](https://cdnjs.com) for my font awesome and I got the css syntax of font-awesome from Font-awesome official website by searching for the icons I want to use

- For my brand icons, I downloaded it from [](https://icons8.com)

- For some fonts I used google fonts [](http://fonts.google.com)

## Process
- I started by downloading images from [](https://www.pexels.com) then I resized it with photo edit and compress it with [](https://tinypng.com)

- Then I Started jotting down possible hotel rooms names and features of a room(fun fact: I used my estate management knowledge here)

- Then I started building out all the html pages 
- After finishing the html pages, I created a folder for my styles and I linked my styles to my html by using an external link

- Then I started styling the html of each page 

- I linked the css file of my main css i.e index.html css file to other html pages to keep me from repeating the header and footer styling and also to maintain the same style for all my headers and footers

## Technologies
- Html semantic tags
- Css selectors, flex and grid
- css variables
- Css custom properties
- Comments
- Netlify: I used this to host my website
